## Overview

This project provides a suite of web-based calculators to convert between altitude and oxygen percentage. These tools help you understand the relationship between elevation and effective oxygen availability at different altitudes, including equivalency calculations for different gas mixtures.

## Use Cases

### 1️⃣ Altitude Analysis
Understand oxygen availability at different altitudes:
- *"What is the effective oxygen percentage at 10,000 feet?"*
- *"At what altitude does oxygen drop to 15%?"*
- *"How does altitude affect oxygen availability for athletic performance?"*

### 2️⃣ Training Planning
Plan training at altitude or simulate altitude conditions:
- *"What oxygen percentage should I expect at my training camp altitude?"*
- *"At what altitude would I experience a specific oxygen percentage?"*

## Available Calculators

| Calculator | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| [Oxygen % to Elevation Calculator](https://dbeatty10.github.io/altitude-calculator/altitude_o2_to_altitude.html) | Calculate equivalent altitude for 20.9% air based on measured altitude and oxygen percentage of gas mixture. |
| [Elevation to Equivalent Oxygen % Calculator](https://dbeatty10.github.io/altitude-calculator/elevation_equiv_to_o2.html) | Calculate required oxygen percentage based on local elevation and desired equivalent altitude. Useful for hypoxic tents ("live high") or Venturi entrainment mask jet percentage calculations ("train low"). |
